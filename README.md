# Water-Contact-Angle
This is a Python script that analysis the dat file generated by GROMACS/LAMMPS and then estimates the water contact angle.
The dat file is a density map where the density of the cylinder (water) is obtained along Z and X while averaging over y.
To do so, first generate an index file where Oxygens of water molecules are selected:
gmx make_ndx -f conf.gro -o index.ndx
then in the promt, use "a OW". OW is the name of the oxygen for water molecule in my case, in your case, it could be different.
Then, gmx densmap is used:
gmx densmap -f prd.xtc -s prd.tpr -n index.ndx -aver y -od density.dat
